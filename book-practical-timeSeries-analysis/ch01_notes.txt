Cross-sectional data
Time Series data
Panel data

# ------------------------------------
# CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA
# ------------------------------------
    It's obtained by taking observations from multiple individuals at the same point in time. Time does not play any significant role in the analysis. In essence, the cross-sectional data represents a snapshot at a given instance of time in both the cases.

# ------------------------------------
# TIME SERIES DATA
# ------------------------------------
    - Quantitative observations on one or more measurable characteristics of an individual entity and taken at multiple points in time.
    - Characteristics:
        - Trend
        - Seasonality
        - Stationarity
        - Autocorrelation

# ------------------------------------
# PANEL DATA ( LONGITUDINAL DATA )
# ------------------------------------
    - Multiple entities over multiple points in time we get a panel data

# ------------------------------------
# INTERNAL STRUCTURES OF TIME SERIES
# ------------------------------------
    1) General trend
    2) Seasonality
    3) Cyclical movements
    4) Unexpected variations 

    1) Genearal Trend
        - When a time series exibits an upward or downward movement in the long run.
        - In order to reveal genearl trend, we need a time series that dates substantially back in the past.
    2) Seasonality
        - It manifests as repetitive and period variations in a time series.
        - Determine seasonality:
            2.1) Run sequence plot
            2.2) Seasonal sub series plot
            2.3) Multiple box plots

            2.1) Run Sequence plot
                - Simple plot of the original time series with time on x-axis and teh variable on y-axis is good for indicating the following properties of the time series:
                    - Movements in mean of the series
                    - Shifts in variance
                    - Presence of outliers

            2.2) Seasonal sub series plot
                - Reveals two properties:
                    - Variation within seasons as within a batch of successive months
                    - Variation between seasons as between batches of successive months

            2.3) Multiple box plots: Displays both central tendency and dispersion within the seasonal data over a batch of time units.

    3) Cyclical changes
        - Movements observed after every few units of time, less frequently than seasonal, might not have a fixed period of variations and it'd be larger.

    4) Unexpected variations
        - Irreducible error component that is random and does not exhibit systematic dependency on the time index.
        - This type of error is due to lack of information about explanatory variables that can model these variations or due the presence of random noise.

# MODELS FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
# ------------------------------------
Building blocks of time series analysis
1) Zero mean models
2) Random walk
3) Trend models
4) Seasonality models 

1) Zero Mean Models
    - Constant Mean and constant Variance
    - No predictable trends or seasonality
    - Data assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( iid )
    - Represent the random noise around a fixed mean.

2) Random walk
    - It's given as a sum of n iids, which has zero mean and constant variance.

3) Trend models
    - Capture the long run trend in the time series that can be fitted as linear regression of the time index.

4) Seasonality models
    - Manifests as periodic and repetitive fluctuations in a time series and hence are modeled as sum of weighted sum of sine waves of known periodicity.  

# -------------------------------------------
# GENERIC APPROACH OF A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
# -------------------------------------------
1) Visualize the data at different granularities of the time index to reveal long run trends and seasonal fluctuations
2) Fit trend line capture long run trends and plot the residuals to check for seasonality or irreducible error
3) Fit a harmonic regression model to capture seasonality
4) Plot the residuals left by the seasonality model to check for irreducible error

# -------------------------------------------
# AUTOCORRELATION AND PARTIAL AUTOCORRELATION
# -------------------------------------------
    - After applying the mathematical transformation, we will often left with a STATIONARY TIME SERIES: constant mean + correlation ( depends only on the time lag between two time steps )

    - Autocorrelation reflects the degree of linear dependency between the time series at index t and the time series at indices t-h or t+h. A positive autocorrelation indicates that the present and future values of the time series move in the same direction.

    - Plotting the observed values of the ACF.

    - Autocorrelation is not the correct measure of the mutual correlation between x_t and x_(t+h) in the presence of the intermediate variables. Hence, it would erroneous to choose h in AR models based on autocorrelation.

    - Partial autocorrelation solves this problem by measuring the correlation between x_t and x_(t+h) when the influence of the intermediate variables has been removed.

    - Partical autocorrelation helps in identifying the order h of an AR(h) model.
