# Stationary Data: 
# -------------------
	- Important for enhancing the time series forecasting model.
	- Deduction of the TREND, SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL components would leave us with irregular fluctuations which cannot be modeled by using only the time index as an exploratory variable
	- The irregular fluctuations are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid) and modeled by a linear regression on variables other than the time index
	- House prices exhibit both trend and seasonal variation. However, the residuals left after adjusting trend and seasonality depends on exogenous variables.

# --------------
# Main Steps:
# --------------
1) Preprocess & visualize time series data
2) Verify stationarity by statistical methods
3) Is stationary?
	Yes) Train Model on exogenous variables
	No ) Stationarize the time Series
4) Train Model on exogenours variables

	- Aggregate values: From second to hour
	- Aggregation techniques:
		- Resampling time series data
		- Performing group-by
		- Calculating moving statistics

1) Resampling time series data

2) Group wise aggregation

3) Moving Statistics

4) Stationary Processes
	- Properties of data: Central Tendency, dispersion, skewness, kurtosis
	- Statistical estimation theory: Sample statistics to be reliable, the population undergo and fundamental or systemic shifts over the individuals in the sample or over the time during which the data has been collected.
	- Stationarity: Requires the internal structures of the time series do not change over time. Therefore, stationarity requires mean, variance, and autocorrelation to be invariant with respect to the actual time of observation.
	- Non-stationarity: Mostly arises due to the presence of trend and seasonality that affects the mean, variance, and autocorrelation at different points in time.
	- Crucical Steps: 1) Statistically verifying stationarity ( Augemented Dickey-Fuller ( ADF ) ) 
		          2) Destationarizing a non-stationary time series through special mathematical operations.
	- Differencing can remove trend and seasonal components.

5) Differencing - Goal: Generate a stationarize time series
	- First-order differencing: ( xt = xt - xt-1 )
	- Second-order differencing: ( xt = xt - 2xt-1 + xt-2 )

6) Seasonal differencing

7) Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

8) Time series decomposition
	- The goal of time series decomposition is to model the long-term trend and seasonality and estimate the overall time series as a combination of them. 
	- Additive model - Applied when there is a time-dependent trend cycle component, but independent seasonality that does not change over time.
	- Multiplicative model - Applied over time-varying seasonality.

	- Moving Averages - Estimate the trend and seasonal components.
	- Weighted moving average
