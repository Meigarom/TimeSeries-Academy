# ------------------------------------------
1) First Order Exponential Smoothing
	- Suitable with Constant Variance and No Seasonality.
	- First Order Exponential Smoothing extendes Simple Moving Average.
	- Assumes equal weight to all historical observations.
	- Window Size for Moving Average increases, the weights assigned to each observation become smaller.
	- First Order Exponentail Smoothing where weights decrease exponentially from recent data point to the oldest.
	- Need to define ALPHA parameter.

2) Second Order Exponential Smoothing
	- Helps capture the trend in time series data by including another term to the first order exponential smoothing ( T term ).
	- T captures the trend component of the exponential smoothing.
	- Need to define AlPHA and BETA parameters.

3) Modeling Higher-Order Exponential Smoothing
	- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
	- Triple Exponential Smoothing.
		- Allows you to capture seasonality with level and trend.
