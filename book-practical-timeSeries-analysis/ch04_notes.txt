# Chapter 04: Auto-Regressive Models
# ------------------------------------------
	- Exponential smoothing-based forecasting techniques:
		- Assumptions:  - Time Series composed on deterministic and stochastic terms.
				- The random component is zero
				- The random noise is truly random and follows independent identical distribution
	- Auto-regressive Models:
		- The concept of auto-regressive model in time series is referred to models that are developed by regression on previous values.
		- Adjust immediately using the prior lag values by taking advantage of inherent serial correlation between observations.
		- Include auto-regressive terms or moving average terms.
		- Moving Average ( MA )
		- Auto-regressive moving average ( ARMA )
		- Auto-regressive integrated moving average ( ARIMA )

1) Auto-regressive models
	- Moving average models: Linear dependence on historical deviation of models from the last prior value.
	- Auto-regressive models: 
		- Regress on time series data is to regress it with its lag term.
		- Very good in capturing trends as the next time values are predicted based on the prior time values.
		- Very useful in situations where the next forecasted value is a function of the previous time period.

2) Moving average models
	- It uses dependency between residual errors to forecast values in the next time period.
	- The model helps yu to adjust for any unpredictable events such as catastrophic events.

3) Building datasets with ARIMA
